Please stop all running Docker containers for the specified user instance by executing the following steps.
IMPORTANT : 
- all commands have to be executed in the application located {{APPLICATION_FOLDER}}.
- Execute all steps to deploy with the environment variable USER_ID={{USER_ID}}

#### 1. Calculate HTTP Ports, which are the ports used by the docker containers of the application. Use the following command:

source {{APPLICATION_FOLDER}}/conf/deploy.ini
if ! [[ "$USER_ID" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    USER_ID=0
fi
export PORT_RANGE_BEGIN=$((RANGE_START+USER_ID*RANGE_RESERVED))
export HTTP_PORT=$((PORT_RANGE_BEGIN+APPLICATION_IDENTITY_NUMBER*RANGE_PORTS_PER_APPLICATION))
export HTTPS_PORT=$((HTTP_PORT+1))
export HTTP_PORT2=$(($HTTPS_PORT+1))
export HTTPS_PORT2=$(($HTTP_PORT2+1))


#### 2. Stop the running application. Use the following commands to stop the application, based on the ports calculated during step 1:

log_info "Stopping {{APPLICATION_NAME}} services..."
# Stop containers by name pattern
containers=$(docker ps -q --filter "name=${NAME_OF_APPLICATION}-.*-${USER_ID}-.*")
if [[ -n "$containers" ]]; then
    docker stop $containers
    docker rm $containers
    log_info "Services stopped successfully ✅"
else
    log_warn "No running containers found for USER_ID: $USER_ID"
fi


**After completion, verify:**
- Networks are removed
- Volumes are preserved
- Report the final status

**Summary:** confirm all services are stopped.
